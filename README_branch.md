# Camera Trigger Branch

This branch is created to add IMU-camera trigger capability in v1.10 firmware. This is to be merged later back into the main v1.10.1_rpt branch

Worked configs:
- boards/px4/fmu-v3/default.cmake
-

NOTE: setting up toolchain installs gcc compiler in `/opt/`, and added the path to `.profile`, reboot is needed
